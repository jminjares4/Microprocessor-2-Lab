# Lab 1
## FREERTOS, TASK AND SEMAPHORES
### Goals
* Given the program template in Listing 1, create a program which uses port interrupts to trigger a task.
* The port interrupts must be connected to external push buttons which will trigger the “print_task”.
* On the “print_task” your program should print that the interrupt was trigger.

### Bonus
* Modify the code so the “print_task” prints what port caused the interrupt.+10
